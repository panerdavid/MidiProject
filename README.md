How to Run
Option 1: Electron
This method provides a dedicated window for the experience.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

npm install
npm start

Option 2: Live Server

Open in VS Code.

Launch Live Server:

Click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of VS Code (requires downloading the Live Server extension).

MIDI Permissions:

When prompted by the browser, ensure you click "Allow" for MIDI device access.

MIDI Configuration

Working on a better way to set this up, but for now the first midi device recognized will control the waves and the second will trigger the sprites that bounce around.
If they aren't connected in the right order simply unplug and replug the connections in the order you want them.
